This would be an application used for analyzing and track different events in your application. I would design it to work specifically with sugarcrm.
It would consists of three parts:
    - The ingestion service: this will recieve events and store them in a mongo db
    - The event reader service: which will read data from the db based on a query and return it to the client
    - The client: which gets all the data and builds meaningful dashboards

The Ingestion service:
    An api that exposes a post endpoint. This will receive a payload consisting of the event data. 
    The events table which is stored in mongodb is made out of these columns:
        - id
        - emmitter_id (this is the sugarcrm unique_key)
        - type (view, click, delete, edit, docmerge)
        - module
        - record_name
        - record_id
        - user_id 
        - user_name
        - message
        - time_spent (specifically for view type action)
    We have emmitter_id which will answer to the question: who is the client?
    We have module, record_name, record_id that tells us where in the app is the client spending time and with the help of type we know what is he doing.
    We have user_id and user_name which tells us who is the current user that uses the app.
